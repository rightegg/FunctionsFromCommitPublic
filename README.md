#An edited Code Vulnerability Dataset Generator

# A C/C++ Code Vulnerability Dataset with Code Changes and CVE Summaries

## 1 . Data Description

- CVE entries in our dataset cover the period from 2002 to 2019, each consisting of 21 features. Each feature's name and corresponding column name in the CSV file are explained in the following table. The dataset is released as comma-separated values(CSV) format ([all_c_cpp_release2.0.csv](https://github.com/ZeoVan/MSR_20_Code_Vulnerability_CSV_Dataset/blob/master/all_c_cpp_release2.0.csv)).

- We used the code changes information(minned from commited version patches) to localize which lines of code in the files were modified. Taking modified lines between the two mini-versions as flaw lines, we split the functions in the modified files into vulnerable functions (if there were flaw lines modified in the function) and non-vulnerable functions.

- ~~The cleaned version of split functions is coming soon.~~

  Pandas is recommended (Python Package, like `pandas.read_csv("filepath/file.csv")` ) to work on the dataset.

  - Split functions are released as comma-separated values(CSV) format:
  
  | Column Name in the CSV |                         Description                          |
  | :--------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
  |      func_before       | The function before the vulnerability being fixed(if "vul" labeled as "1", then this is the vulnerable function) |
  |       func_after       |       The function after the vulnerability being fixed       |
  |      lines_before      | The modified lines in the founction before the vulnerability being fixed |
  |      lines_after       | The modified lines in the founction after the vulnerability being fixed |
  |          vul           | "1" means vulnerable function and "0" means non-vulnerable function |
  |   vul_func_with_fix    |  The code comments showing how the vulnerability was fixed   |
## 2. HOW To Use The Scripts

- Pre-Requirements
    - [Python3](https://www.linuxbabe.com/ubuntu/install-python-3-6-ubuntu-16-04-16-10-17-04)
  - [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#installing-beautiful-soup)
    - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/getting_started.html)
  
  - How to use
    - First use [scrape_all_the_cve.py](https://github.com/ZeoVan/MSR_20_Code_Vulnerability_CSV_Dataset/blob/master/scripts/scrape_all_the_cve.py) to scrape all the CVE entries on CVE Details
    - Then use [get_commit_info](https://github.com/ZeoVan/MSR_20_Code_Vulnerability_CSV_Dataset/blob/master/scripts/get_commit_info.py) to get commit messages
    - Finally crawl down all the source files and patch files using commit messages above, and then split all the functions in the modified files, see [all_cpp_c_project_with_chrome_android.ipynb](https://github.com/ZeoVan/MSR_20_Code_Vulnerability_CSV_Dataset/blob/master/notebooks/all_cpp_c_project_with_chrome_android.ipynb) for details.
